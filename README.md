# Cortex

Multi-agent orchestration system built on Elixir/OTP. Cortex manages teams of AI agents that collaborate on complex, multi-step objectives via `claude -p` processes.

It supports three coordination modes: **DAG orchestration** for structured, dependency-aware execution, **mesh** for autonomous agents with optional peer messaging, and **gossip protocol** for emergent, decentralized knowledge sharing.

Built on Elixir/OTP because the problem is inherently concurrent — dozens of long-lived agent processes, message routing, failure detection, real-time streaming. OTP provides supervision trees, GenServers, Erlang ports, PubSub, and Phoenix LiveView out of the box. Every piece of infrastructure that would need to be hand-rolled in other stacks comes for free.

## Modes

Cortex supports three coordination modes. Each mode defines how agents are organized, how they communicate, and how much coordination is imposed.

### Workflow (DAG)

Structured, dependency-aware execution. Define teams with explicit dependencies — Cortex builds a DAG, sorts into parallel tiers via Kahn's algorithm, and executes tier by tier. Upstream results are injected into downstream prompts.

**Use when:** you have a multi-step project with clear dependencies (backend before frontend, research before implementation).

- Teams run in parallel within a tier, sequentially across tiers
- Fault recovery — continue interrupted runs, resume stalled sessions, restart with injected log history
- File-based messaging — coordinator can send mid-run guidance to teams

### Mesh

Autonomous agents with optional peer messaging. Each agent gets a roster of who else is in the cluster and can message them if needed, but there's no forced coordination. Agents work independently on their assignments and reach out only when they need info from another agent's domain.

**Use when:** you have parallel workstreams that are mostly independent but might benefit from occasional cross-talk (multiple researchers, parallel feature builds, distributed analysis).

- SWIM-inspired membership — agents tracked through alive → suspect → dead lifecycle states
- Failure detection — periodic heartbeat checks with configurable suspect/dead timeouts
- Message relay — outbox polling delivers cross-agent messages via file-based inboxes
- Thin orchestrator (~300 LOC) — spawn agents, provide roster, get out of the way

### Gossip

Emergent, decentralized knowledge sharing. Agents explore different angles of a topic independently. A coordinator periodically reads their findings, runs gossip protocol exchanges between knowledge stores, and delivers merged knowledge back to agents.

**Use when:** you want multiple agents exploring a broad topic and cross-pollinating ideas (market research, brainstorming, literature review).

- CRDT-backed knowledge stores with vector clocks for conflict-free convergence
- Push-pull exchange — agents compare digests, fetch missing/newer entries, merge with causal ordering
- Topology strategies — full mesh, ring, and random-k peering
- Optional coordinator agent that can steer exploration and terminate early

## Features

### Observability
- **Live token tracking** — NDJSON usage parsed in real-time, streamed to LiveView via PubSub
- **Activity feed** — tool use events extracted from agent output, displayed as a live timeline
- **Stalled detection** — teams flagged after 5 minutes of silence, with per-team health indicators
- **Diagnostics** — LogParser structures NDJSON into timelines with auto-diagnosis (died during tool use, hit max turns, rate limited, no session, etc.)
- **Telemetry + Prometheus + Grafana** — structured telemetry events, `/metrics` endpoint, pre-configured dashboards

### Dashboard (Phoenix LiveView)
- **Run detail** — 5 tabs: Overview, Activity, Messages, Logs, Diagnostics
- **Overview** — coordinator status, status grid (pending/running/stalled/done/failed), DAG visualization, token counters
- **Messages** — per-team inbox/outbox viewer with send form
- **Diagnostics** — event timeline, diagnosis banners, resume/restart buttons per team
- **Team detail** — individual team page with prompt, logs, and recovery actions
- **Gossip view** — topology visualization with round-by-round knowledge propagation

### Infrastructure
- **Pluggable tool system** — sandboxed execution with timeouts and crash isolation
- **Persistent event log** — all orchestration events stored in SQLite via Ecto
- **Liveness checks** — spawner monitors port processes every 2 minutes, catches silent deaths

## Docker Backend

Cortex can run agent teams inside Docker containers instead of local processes. Each team gets a pod-like pair of containers — a **sidecar** (gRPC bridge to the Cortex gateway) and a **worker** (polls sidecar, runs `claude -p`). Set `backend: docker` in your YAML config and Cortex handles the full container lifecycle.

### How it works

1. Cortex creates a per-run bridge network for isolation
2. For each team, it spawns a sidecar + worker container pair on that network
3. The sidecar connects back to Cortex via gRPC; the worker polls the sidecar for tasks and runs `claude -p`
4. Results flow back through the sidecar → gateway → Cortex pipeline
5. On completion, containers and the bridge network are cleaned up

### Setup

Build the combo image (sidecar + worker in one image):

```bash
make docker-combo                     # mock mode (no Claude CLI)
make docker-combo-claude              # with Claude CLI baked in
```

### Configuration

```yaml
defaults:
  backend: docker                     # or set per-team
```

Environment variables forwarded to worker containers: `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_MAX_TURNS`, `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

### E2E Tests

End-to-end tests run Cortex in a Docker container via compose; the Go test is a pure API client.

```bash
# Mock agent (no API key needed)
make e2e-docker-simple                # single-team DAG
make e2e-docker-multi                 # 3-team multi-tier DAG

# Real Claude (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or ../.key file)
make e2e-docker-simple-claude         # single-team DAG
make e2e-docker-multi-claude          # 3-team multi-tier DAG
```

The Makefile handles `docker compose up/down` around each test run. Cortex gets a Docker socket mount so it can dynamically spawn sidecar + worker containers per team.

## Kubernetes Backend

Cortex can run agent teams as Kubernetes pods. Same sidecar + worker architecture as Docker, but pods are scheduled by K8s with proper RBAC, health probes, resource limits, and label-based lifecycle management. Set `backend: k8s` in your YAML config.

### How it works

1. Cortex creates a Pod per team with two containers — sidecar and worker — sharing localhost networking
2. The sidecar registers with the Cortex gateway via gRPC; the worker polls the sidecar and runs `claude -p`
3. Pods are labeled with `cortex.dev/run-id` and `cortex.dev/team` for tracking and batch cleanup
4. Health probes on the sidecar (`/health`) drive readiness and liveness checks
5. `activeDeadlineSeconds` (default 1 hour) acts as a safety net against orphaned pods
6. On completion, pods are deleted; `cleanup_run_pods/2` can batch-delete all pods for a run

### Pod architecture

```
Pod: cortex-<run-id>-<team-name>
├── sidecar     (gRPC bridge → Cortex gateway, /health endpoint, port 9091)
└── worker      (polls sidecar, runs claude -p, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from K8s Secret)
```

### RBAC

Cortex needs a ServiceAccount with permissions to create, get, list, delete, and watch pods:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/rbac.yaml       # creates cortex-agent-spawner SA + cortex-pod-manager Role
```

### Configuration

```yaml
defaults:
  backend: k8s                        # or set per-team
```

Environment variables for the K8s backend:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `K8S_NAMESPACE` | `default` | Namespace for agent pods |
| `K8S_GATEWAY_URL` | `cortex-gateway:4001` | gRPC gateway address (from inside the cluster) |
| `K8S_SIDECAR_IMAGE` | `cortex-agent-worker:latest` | Sidecar container image |
| `K8S_WORKER_IMAGE` | `cortex-agent-worker:latest` | Worker container image |
| `K8S_IMAGE_PULL_POLICY` | — | `Always`, `IfNotPresent`, or `Never` |

Worker containers receive `CLAUDE_MODEL`, `CLAUDE_MAX_TURNS`, `CLAUDE_PERMISSION_MODE` from team config. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is injected from a K8s Secret (`anthropic-api-key`).

### E2E Tests

End-to-end tests use a local [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster. Cortex runs as a deployment inside the cluster and dynamically spawns agent pods per team.

```bash
# Mock agent (no API key needed)
make e2e-k8s-simple                   # single-team DAG
make e2e-k8s-multi                    # 3-team multi-tier DAG

# Real Claude (requires ANTHROPIC_API_KEY or ../.key file)
make e2e-k8s-simple-claude            # single-team DAG
make e2e-k8s-multi-claude             # 3-team multi-tier DAG

# Teardown
make e2e-k8s-teardown                 # delete the kind cluster
```

The Makefile manages the full lifecycle: kind cluster creation, image loading, deployment, and port-forwarding. The real-Claude targets patch the `anthropic-api-key` secret with your real key and set `CLAUDE_COMMAND=claude` on the Cortex deployment at runtime — no manifest changes needed.

Watch agent pods during a test run:

```bash
kubectl --context kind-cortex-e2e get pods -w
```

You'll see Cortex roll out, then agent pods (e.g., `cortex-<run-id>-researcher`, `cortex-<run-id>-analyst`) spin up as the DAG executes.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.17+
- Erlang/OTP 27+
- [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-cli) (`claude -p` must be available)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/itsHabib/cortex.git && cd cortex
mix deps.get
mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate
mix test
```

### Start the dashboard

```bash
mix phx.server
# http://localhost:4000
```

### Create a config

The easiest way to create a config is with the Claude Code skill:

```
/cortex-config
```

This walks you through choosing a mode, describing your project, and writes the YAML for you.

Or create configs manually — see [Configuration](#configuration) for the schema.

### Run an orchestration

```bash
# Dry run — show execution plan without spawning agents
mix cortex.run examples/mesh-simple.yaml --dry-run

# Run
mix cortex.run examples/mesh-simple.yaml

# Resume stalled teams in an existing workspace
mix cortex.resume /path/to/workspace

# Auto-retry on rate limits
mix cortex.resume /path/to/workspace --auto-retry --retry-delay 120
```

You can also launch runs directly from the dashboard at `http://localhost:4000`.

### Full stack (with Grafana)

```bash
make up    # Phoenix:4000 + Prometheus:9090 + Grafana:3000 (admin/cortex)
```

## Configuration

Projects are defined in YAML. Three modes:

**DAG workflow** — teams with dependencies, executed in parallel tiers:

```yaml
teams:
  - name: backend
    lead: { role: "Backend Engineer" }
    tasks: [{ summary: "Build the API", deliverables: ["api.ex"] }]
  - name: frontend
    lead: { role: "Frontend Engineer" }
    tasks: [{ summary: "Build the UI" }]
    depends_on: [backend]
```

**Mesh** — autonomous agents with optional peer messaging:

```yaml
mode: mesh
mesh: { heartbeat_interval_seconds: 30, suspect_timeout_seconds: 90 }
agents:
  - name: market-sizing
    role: "Market researcher"
    prompt: "Research market size and growth..."
  - name: competitor-analysis
    role: "Competitive analyst"
    prompt: "Map the competitive landscape..."
```

**Gossip** — agents explore independently, knowledge exchanged periodically:

```yaml
mode: gossip
gossip: { rounds: 3, topology: full_mesh, exchange_interval_seconds: 30 }
agents:
  - name: analyst
    topic: "competitors"
    prompt: "Research the top 5 competitors..."
```

See `examples/` for complete configs (`dag-demo.yaml`, `gossip-simple.yaml`, `mesh-simple.yaml`).
