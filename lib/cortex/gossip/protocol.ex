defmodule Cortex.Gossip.Protocol do
  @moduledoc """
  Push-pull gossip exchange between two `KnowledgeStore` processes.

  The protocol synchronizes knowledge between two stores in a single exchange:

  1. Get digests (list of `{entry_id, vector_clock}`) from both stores
  2. Diff the digests to determine what each side is missing or has newer
  3. Fetch the needed entries from each side
  4. Merge the received entries into each store

  After an exchange, both stores converge toward the same knowledge state.

  @doc """
  Performs a bidirectional gossip exchange between two `KnowledgeStore` processes.

  Both stores exchange digests, compute diffs, fetch missing/newer entries,
  and merge them. After a successful exchange, both stores have converged
  their knowledge.

  ## Parameters

    - `store_a` — the first KnowledgeStore (pid or name)
    - `store_b` — the second KnowledgeStore (pid or name)

  ## Returns

    - `:ok` on successful exchange
