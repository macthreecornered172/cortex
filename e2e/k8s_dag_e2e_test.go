// Package e2e contains high-level end-to-end tests for the K8s spawn backend.
//
// These tests exercise the full orchestration flow with Kubernetes pods:
//
//  1. Makefile creates a kind cluster, loads images, deploys Cortex
//  2. Go test POSTs a multi-team DAG config with backend: k8s
//  3. Cortex auto-spawns K8s Pods (sidecar + worker) per team
//  4. Workers complete tasks (mock by default)
//  5. Poll until run completes
//  6. Verify all agent pods cleaned up
//
// Run:
//
//	make e2e-k8s-simple   # mock agent (no API key needed)
//	make e2e-k8s-multi    # 3-team DAG
